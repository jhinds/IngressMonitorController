# Kubernetes and updown

Monitoring uptime is very important; and when using microservices it becomes even more important to ensure all services are up and running; and get alerts when they go down. There is nothing worse then your website going down and you hearing about it from someone else. 

When it comes to downtime, every second counts. Updown is one such service which sends alerts when services become unavailable. IngressMonitorController from Stakater automates the management of URL endpoint monitors in Updown using kubernetes events.
